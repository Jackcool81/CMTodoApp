Hello, my name is Jack with alot of help from this video series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOiXndQAZpw 
I created a UI for an extremly simple todo app. I used TVAC Studio's UI meshed with this git hub 
https://github.com/dipak2726/flutter_firebase_auth to create the authorization system, for the firebase database. 
For the connection between the app and Firebase database was all me, I used some resources online but it was 
my work.
